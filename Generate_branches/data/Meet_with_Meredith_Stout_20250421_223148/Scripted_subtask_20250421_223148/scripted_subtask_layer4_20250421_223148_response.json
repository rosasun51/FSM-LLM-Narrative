  "description": "The player cautiously proposes a trade, offering insights or goods that could satisfy Meredith Stout's relentless pursuit of information regarding the stolen robot. Meredith's sharp wit and calculating nature emerge as she deliberates the terms, fully aware that any deal could tip the balance of power in either direction.",
  "dialogue": "Meredith raises an eyebrow, her expression a blend of intrigue and skepticism. 'So, you want to make a deal? What do you have that is worth my time? Be careful; I don\u2019t take kindly to wasteful exchanges.' Her voice is steady, but there's an unmistakable edge in the air, hinting at the potential volatility of negotiations in a world where trust is as scarce as the goods she seeks.",
