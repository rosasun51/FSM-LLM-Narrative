  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"meet_with_meredith_stout\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"meet_with_meredith_stout\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  the following layers have the same structure (Layer 4, Layer 5, etc.)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 4 with ID \"meet_with_meredith_stout.4\" that has parent_id \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3\".\n\nPreviously generated subtasks:\n- Layer 1 Subtask: A Calculated Encounter\n  Description: The player meets Meredith Stout in the shadowy alley, amid the decay and the remnants of violence. The air is thick with tension as the two engage in a conversation where loyalty and motives are carefully assessed. Meredith's sharp gaze scrutinizes the player, weighing their potential as either an ally or threat.\n- Layer 2 Subtask: Unmasking the Connection\n  Description: As Meredith leans closer, her eyes narrowing with suspicion, she probes the player about their past and connections. The tension thickens as she demands to know how the player might be tied to her investigation and whether they know anything about her stolen goods.\n- Layer 3 Subtask: The Price of Information\n  Description: In the dim light of the alley, Meredith Stout's demeanor shifts as she sizes up the player, feeling the weight of the stolen goods that might change her investigation's fate. She grimly demands to know if the player possesses any information related to the missing items, mentioning a suspicious trade involving a stolen robot.
