  "description": "In the dim light of the alley, Meredith Stout's demeanor shifts as she sizes up the player, feeling the weight of the stolen goods that might change her investigation's fate. She grimly demands to know if the player possesses any information related to the missing items, mentioning a suspicious trade involving a stolen robot. This moment hangs heavy in the air as both parties assess the potential gains and losses.",
  "dialogue": "Meredith leans forward, her eyes assessing. 'You've got something, don\u2019t you? A lead? A clue? If you want a nice little favor from me, you\u2019ll have to spill what you know about that missing robot. Otherwise, we\u2019ll have a problem.'",
