  "description": "As you stand in Joe's dimly lit shop, a sense of unease creeps over you. While Joe appears ready to assist, the shadows of the cyberpunk world outside whisper of unseen dangers. You ponder the potential obstacles that could impede your plans: rival hackers, unexpected surveillance, or the dubious reliability of Joe's services. Clarifying these risks might be necessary before proceeding.",
  "dialogue": "You take a deep breath, weighing your options. 'What are the potential risks here? Could Joe double-cross me? Or is there something more lurking in the shadows that I need to fear?' You look at Joe, searching for any hint of deceit.",
