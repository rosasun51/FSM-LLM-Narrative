  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"clear_virus\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"clear_virus\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"clear_virus.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"clear_virus.1.1\", \"clear_virus.1.2\", \"clear_virus.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"clear_virus.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"clear_virus.2.1\", \"clear_virus.2.2\", \"clear_virus.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"clear_virus.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"clear_virus.3.1\", \"clear_virus.3.2\", \"clear_virus.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  the following layers have the same structure (Layer 4, Layer 5, etc.)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 4 with ID \"clear_virus.4\" that has parent_id \"clear_virus.3\".\n\nPreviously generated subtasks:\n- Layer 1 Subtask: Assessing the Digital Needs\n  Description: As you step deeper into the hacker service shop, the atmosphere hums with anticipation. Joe, the owner's weathered face illuminated by the glow of multiple screens, leans forward. He senses your presence before you even speak, ready to dive into the digital abyss with you. It's time to clarify your needs to secure Joe's assistance in clearing the virus plaguing your system.\n- Layer 2 Subtask: Negotiating the Price\n  Description: As the flickering lights cast dancing shadows across the walls, you face Joe, weighing your options carefully. The tension in the air is palpable as he leans back in his chair, expectantly waiting for your response. Will you meet his demand, or will you haggle for a better deal?\n- Layer 3 Subtask: Stance on the Deal\n  Description: As you deliberate your next move, Joe studies your demeanor, trying to gauge your attitude towards the precarious arrangement. The flickering neon lights reflect off his glasses as he leans in, awaiting your sentiment. Are you eager to secure his help, or are you hesitant and ready to negotiate further?\n\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Clear Virus\",\n  \"location\": \"3\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"1;2,4\",\n    \"additional_conditions\": \"Player accepted the cash chip provided by Meredith Stout\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"In a dark, neon-lit backstreet, the hacker service shop buzzes with an undercurrent of digital intrigue.
