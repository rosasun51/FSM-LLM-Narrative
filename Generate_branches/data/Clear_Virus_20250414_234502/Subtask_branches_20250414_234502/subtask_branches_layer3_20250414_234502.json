Your job is to generate alternative narrative branches in response to a transitioning question.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree has a ROOT TASK (ID \"clear_virus\") with 3 layers of subtasks\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"clear_virus\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"clear_virus.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"clear_virus.1.1\", \"clear_virus.1.2\", \"clear_virus.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"clear_virus.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"clear_virus.2.1\", \"clear_virus.2.2\", \"clear_virus.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"clear_virus.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"clear_virus.3.1\", \"clear_virus.3.2\", \"clear_virus.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  the following layers have the same structure (Layer 4, Layer 5, etc.)\n\nYou are generating 3 alternative branches for Layer 3.\nThese alternatives will have:\n- Parent ID: \"clear_virus.3\" (the scripted subtask of this layer)\n- Layer: 3\n- IDs: \"clear_virus.3.1\", \"clear_virus.3.2\", \"clear_virus.3.3\" and so on (for each alternative)\n- is_generated: true (as these are generated alternatives)\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Clear Virus\",\n  \"location\": \"3\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"1;2,4\",\n    \"additional_conditions\": \"Player accepted the cash chip provided by Meredith Stout\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"In a dark, neon-lit backstreet, the hacker service shop buzzes with an undercurrent of digital intrigue.
