  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"meet_with_meredith_stout\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"meet_with_meredith_stout\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  the following layers have the same structure (Layer 4, Layer 5, etc.)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 5 with ID \"meet_with_meredith_stout.5\" that has parent_id \"meet_with_meredith_stout.4\".\n\nPreviously generated subtasks:\n- Layer 1 Subtask: Tense Confrontation\n  Description: In a dimly lit alley, you face Meredith Stout, who watches you with suspicion. The air is thick with tension as she assesses whether you pose a threat to her. Her eyes narrow, waiting for your move.\n- Layer 2 Subtask: Unmasking Connections\n  Description: As Meredith studies you intently, the weight of your shared past hangs in the air. You must decide whether to reveal your identity and the extent of your connection to her, risking possible consequences.\n- Layer 3 Subtask: Bargain in the Shadows\n  Description: In this tense moment, you reveal that you possess crucial information about the missing goods Meredith is searching for. The air hums with anticipation as Meredith's expression shifts from suspicion to consideration, weighing the value of your offer.\n- Layer 4 Subtask: The Trade Proposition\n  Description: You weigh your options and prepare to propose a trade to Meredith Stout, sensing that the outcome will hinge on your offer. The tension is palpable as you decide how to present your information about the missing goods.\n\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"scene_name\": \"Meet with Meredith Stout\",\n  \"location\": \"1\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"1;2,3\",\n    \"additional_conditions\": \"Completed contact with Meredith Stout\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"The alley was a scar of cracked concrete and rusting pipes, choked by tangled wires and creeping decay.
