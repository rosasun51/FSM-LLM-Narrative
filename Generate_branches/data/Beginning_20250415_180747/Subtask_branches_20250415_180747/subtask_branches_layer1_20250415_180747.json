These alternatives should:\n1. Be alternative responses to the same transitioning question as the scripted subtask\n2. Offer meaningfully different narrative paths than the scripted subtask\n3. Maintain logical consistency with the task information\n4. Have the scripted subtask as their parent\n5. For each alternative branch, analyze the NPC(s) involved. Based on their initial emotion pool (from Task Information), their background/personality (provided above as 'Relevant Character Backgrounds/Personalities'), and the events of *this specific alternative branch*. **If background/personality information *is* available for an NPC**, potentially add new entries to that NPC's emotion pool (the top-level 'npc_emotion_pools' field in the output for this branch) if the branch introduces relevant new emotional triggers or goals. Maintain the original structure (`[{\"id\": int, \"trigger_condition\": str|null, \"goal\": str}]`). **If no additions are necessary, or if background information is missing for an NPC, keep the original pool for that NPC unchanged.**\n6. For each alternative, include the following fields. Populate them with relevant information for that specific alternative branch. If information is in the input 'Task Information' and relevant, use it. Otherwise, generate sensible content or use null/empty structures:\n   - `environment`: A string describing the environment for this branch.\n   - `interactive_environment_objects`: A list of objects (e.g., `[{\"name\": \"object_name\", \"action_point_cost\": \"cost_string_or_int\"}]`) or null for this branch.\n   - `interactive_npc`: A list of NPC objects (e.g., `[{\"name\": \"npc_name\", \"additional_conditions\": \"string_or_null\", \"goal\": \"string\", \"emotion_pool\": [{\"id\": \"string_or_int\", \"trigger_condition\": \"string_or_null\", \"goal\": \"string\"}]}]`) relevant to this branch, or null.\n   - `key_questions`: Copy this directly from the input 'Task Information' (e.g., `[{\"id\": \"string_or_int\", \"content\": \"question_string\"}]` or `[{\"id\": \"string_or_int\", \"english\": \"question_string\"}]`).\n   - `scene_end_state_reference`: An object describing end conditions for this branch (e.g., `{\"end_condition1\": \"string_or_null\", \"end_condition2\": \"string_or_null\"}`) or null.\n\nRate each possibility on a 100-point scale (only those rated 80+ will be considered viable).\n\nYour response MUST be a JSON array of not more than 3 objects with this format:\n[\n  {\n    \"subtask_id\": \"beginning.1.1\",\n    \"title\": \"Brief, catchy title for the branch\",\n    \"description\": \"Clear description of what happens in this branch\",\n    \"dialogue\": \"The main narrative text for the player\",\n    \"npc_reactions\": {\"npc_name\": \"reaction description\", ...},\n    \"npc_emotion_pools\": {\"npc_name\": [{\"id\": int, \"trigger_condition\": str|null, \"goal\": str}], ...},\n    \"player_options\": [\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"],\n    \"parent_id\": \"beginning.1\",\n    \"layer\": 1,\n    \"is_generated\": true,\n    \"rating\": 85,\n    \"environment\": \"Detailed description of this alternative branch's environment.\",\n    \"interactive_environment_objects\": [{\"name\": \"branch_object\", \"action_point_cost\": \"1\"}],\n    \"interactive_npc\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"NPC Name From Task Info\",\n        \"additional_conditions\": \"Any specific conditions for this NPC in this branch, or null.\",\n        \"goal\": \"NPC's goal relevant to this branch context.\",\n        \"emotion_pool\": [{\"id\": \"original_id\", \"trigger_condition\": \"original_trigger\", \"goal\": \"original_goal\"}]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"key_questions\": [{\"id\": \"q1\", \"content\": \"Copied key question 1 from task_info?\"}],\n    \"scene_end_state_reference\": { \"end_condition1\": \"End condition for branch 1\", \"end_condition2\": \"Another end condition for branch 1\" }\n  },\n  {\n    \"subtask_id\": \"beginning.1.2\",\n    \"title\": \"Second alternative branch title\",\n    \"description\": \"Description of the second alternative\",\n    \"dialogue\": \"Dialogue for the second alternative\",\n    \"npc_reactions\": {\"npc_name\": \"reaction description\", ...},\n    \"npc_emotion_pools\": {\"npc_name\": [{\"id\": int, \"trigger_condition\": str|null, \"goal\": str}], ...},\n    \"player_options\": [\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"],\n    \"parent_id\": \"beginning.1\",\n    \"layer\": 1,\n    \"is_generated\": true,\n    \"rating\": 80,\n    \"environment\": \"Description for second alternative's environment.\",\n    \"interactive_environment_objects\": [],\n    \"interactive_npc\": [],\n    \"key_questions\": [{\"id\": \"q1\", \"content\": \"Copied key question 1 from task_info?\"}],\n    \"scene_end_state_reference\": { \"end_condition1\": \"End condition for branch 2\" }\n  },\n  {\n    \"subtask_id\": \"beginning.1.3\",\n    \"title\": \"Third alternative branch title\",\n    \"description\": \"Description of the third alternative\",\n    \"dialogue\": \"Dialogue for the third alternative\",\n    \"npc_reactions\": {\"npc_name\": \"reaction description\", ...},\n    \"npc_emotion_pools\": {\"npc_name\": [{\"id\": int, \"trigger_condition\": str|null, \"goal\": str}], ...},\n    \"player_options\": [\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"],\n    \"parent_id\": \"beginning.1\",\n    \"layer\": 1,\n    \"is_generated\": true,\n    \"rating\": 75,\n    \"environment\": \"Description for third alternative's environment.\",\n    \"interactive_environment_objects\": [],\n    \"interactive_npc\": [],\n    \"key_questions\": [{\"id\": \"q1\", \"content\": \"Copied key question 1 from task_info?\"}],\n    \"scene_end_state_reference\": { \"end_condition1\": \"End condition for branch 3\" }\n  }\n]\n\nYOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON: An array with not more than 3 objects.\n",
