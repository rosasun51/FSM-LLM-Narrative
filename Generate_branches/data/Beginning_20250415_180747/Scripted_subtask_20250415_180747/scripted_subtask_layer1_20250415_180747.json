  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"beginning\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"beginning\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"beginning.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"beginning.1.1\", \"beginning.1.2\", \"beginning.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"beginning.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"beginning.2.1\", \"beginning.2.2\", \"beginning.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"beginning.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"beginning.3.1\", \"beginning.3.2\", \"beginning.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  the following layers have the same structure (Layer 4, Layer 5, etc.)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 1 with ID \"beginning.1\" that has parent_id \"beginning\".\n\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Beginning\",\n  \"location\": \"0\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"1;1\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"In a dimly-lit office, the gangster boss sits behind a polished desk.

The atmosphere hints at hidden power and secrets, with a quiet hum from concealed devices setting a mysterious tone.\",\n  \"interactive_environment_objects\": null,\n  \"interactive_npc\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ronan\",\n      \"additional_conditions\": null,\n      \"goal\": \"Assign the player a task to pick up goods and provide advice on contacting Meredith Stout.\",\n      \"emotion_pool\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"0\",\n          \"trigger_condition\": null,\n          \"goal\": \"Assign tasks to the player, provide advice, and answer the player's questions.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"1\",\n          \"trigger_condition\": \"The player asks about the task too many times or constantly goes off-topic\",\n          \"goal\": \"Seriously remind the player that this task is very important.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"key_questions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"0\",\n      \"content\": \"What's player's reaction after knowing this task?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"1\",\n      \"content\": \"Is the player willing to accept Ronan's task?\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"scene_end_state_reference\": {\n    \"end_condition1\": \"The player indicates understanding of the task\",\n    \"end_condition2\": \"The player explicitly refuses the task\"\n  }\n}\n\nRelevant Character Backgrounds/Personalities:\n{\n  \"Ronan\": {\n    \"error\": \"Background not found\"\n  }\n}\n\nTransitioning Question: What's player's reaction after knowing this task?\n\nYOUR TASK: Create a scripted subtask that will serve as the main canonical path in Layer 1 of the narrative structure. This subtask:\n1. Directly addresses the transitioning question\n2. Will be the primary response at this layer level\n3. Forms a parent for the next level's subtask or alternatives\n4. Has a parent_id of \"beginning\"\n5. Has is_generated set to \"False\" (as this is a scripted, not generated subtask)\n6. Considers the NPC's initial emotion pool (from Task Information) and background/personality (provided above as 'Relevant Character Backgrounds/Personalities'). **If background/personality information *is* available for an NPC**, potentially add new entries to that NPC's emotion pool (the top-level 'npc_emotion_pools' field in the output) based on the events of *this specific subtask* if it introduces relevant new emotional triggers or goals. Maintain the original structure for the emotion pool (`[{\"id\": int, \"trigger_condition\": str|null, \"goal\": str}]`). **If no additions are necessary, or if background information is missing for an NPC, keep the original pool for that NPC unchanged.**\n7. Include the following fields. Populate them with relevant information. If the information is directly available in the input 'Task Information', use that. Otherwise, you can generate sensible content or use null/empty structures where appropriate for this specific subtask:\n   - `environment`: A string describing the environment.\n   - `interactive_environment_objects`: A list of objects (e.g., `[{\"name\": \"object_name\", \"action_point_cost\": \"cost_string_or_int\"}]`) or null.\n   - `interactive_npc`: A list of NPC objects (e.g., `[{\"name\": \"npc_name\", \"additional_conditions\": \"string_or_null\", \"goal\": \"string\", \"emotion_pool\": [{\"id\": \"string_or_int\", \"trigger_condition\": \"string_or_null\", \"goal\": \"string\"}]}]`) or null. These should reflect the NPCs present in the scene with their original details.\n   - `key_questions`: Copy this directly from the input 'Task Information' (e.g., `[{\"id\": \"string_or_int\", \"content\": \"question_string\"}]` or `[{\"id\": \"string_or_int\", \"english\": \"question_string\"}]`).\n   - `scene_end_state_reference`: An object describing end conditions (e.g., `{\"end_condition1\": \"string_or_null\", \"end_condition2\": \"string_or_null\"}`) or null.\n\nYour response MUST be a JSON object with this format:\n{\n  \"subtask_id\": \"beginning.1\",\n  \"title\": \"Brief, catchy title for the subtask\",\n  \"description\": \"Clear description of what happens in this subtask\",\n  \"dialogue\": \"The main narrative text for the player\",\n  \"npc_reactions\": {\"npc_name\": \"reaction description\", ...},\n  \"npc_emotion_pools\": {\"npc_name\": [{\"id\": int, \"trigger_condition\": str|null, \"goal\": str}], ...},\n  \"player_options\": [\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"],\n  \"parent_id\": \"beginning\",\n  \"layer\": 1,\n  \"is_generated\": false,\n  \"environment\": \"Detailed description of the subtask's environment.\",\n  \"interactive_environment_objects\": [{\"name\": \"object_name\", \"action_point_cost\": \"1\"}],\n  \"interactive_npc\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"NPC Name From Task Info\",\n      \"additional_conditions\": \"Any specific conditions for this NPC in this context, or null.\",\n      \"goal\": \"NPC's goal relevant to this subtask context.\",\n      \"emotion_pool\": [{\"id\": \"original_id\", \"trigger_condition\": \"original_trigger\", \"goal\": \"original_goal\"}]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"key_questions\": [{\"id\": \"q1\", \"content\": \"Copied key question 1 from task_info?\"}],\n  \"scene_end_state_reference\": { \"end_condition1\": \"Description of end condition 1\", \"end_condition2\": \"Description of end condition 2\" }\n}\n\nYOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON: A single JSON object with the exact keys shown above.\n",
