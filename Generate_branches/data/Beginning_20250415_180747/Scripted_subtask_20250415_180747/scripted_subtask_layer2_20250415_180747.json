  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"beginning\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"beginning\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"beginning.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"beginning.1.1\", \"beginning.1.2\", \"beginning.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"beginning.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"beginning.2.1\", \"beginning.2.2\", \"beginning.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"beginning.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"beginning.3.1\", \"beginning.3.2\", \"beginning.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  the following layers have the same structure (Layer 4, Layer 5, etc.)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 2 with ID \"beginning.2\" that has parent_id \"beginning.1\".\n\nPreviously generated subtasks:\n- Layer 1 Subtask: The Weight of Responsibility\n  Description: Ronan leans forward, his expression serious as he outlines the task at hand. You feel the implications of your actions pressing down as he details the importance of picking up the goods and connecting with Meredith Stout.\n\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Beginning\",\n  \"location\": \"0\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"1;1\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"In a dimly-lit office, the gangster boss sits behind a polished desk.

This subtask:\n1. Directly addresses the transitioning question\n2. Will be the primary response at this layer level \n3. Forms a parent for the next level's subtask or alternatives\n4. Has a parent_id of \"beginning.1\"\n5. Has is_generated set to \"False\" (as this is a scripted, not generated subtask)\n\nYour response MUST be a JSON object with this format:\n{\n  \"subtask_id\": \"beginning.2\",\n  \"title\": \"Brief, catchy title for the subtask\",\n  \"description\": \"Clear description of what happens in this subtask\",\n  \"dialogue\": \"The main narrative text for the player\",\n  \"npc_reactions\": {\"npc_name\": \"reaction description\", ...},\n  \"player_options\": [\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"],\n  \"parent_id\": \"beginning.1\",\n  \"layer\": 2,\n  \"is_generated\": false\n}\n\nYOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON: A single JSON object with the exact keys shown above.\n",
