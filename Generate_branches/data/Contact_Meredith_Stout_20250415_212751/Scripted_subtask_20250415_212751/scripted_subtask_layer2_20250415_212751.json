  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"contact_meredith_stout\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"contact_meredith_stout\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"contact_meredith_stout.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"contact_meredith_stout.1.1\", \"contact_meredith_stout.1.2\", \"contact_meredith_stout.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"contact_meredith_stout.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"contact_meredith_stout.2.1\", \"contact_meredith_stout.2.2\", \"contact_meredith_stout.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"contact_meredith_stout.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"contact_meredith_stout.3.1\", \"contact_meredith_stout.3.2\", \"contact_meredith_stout.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  the following layers have the same structure (Layer 4, Layer 5, etc.)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 2 with ID \"contact_meredith_stout.2\" that has parent_id \"contact_meredith_stout.1\".\n\nPreviously generated subtasks:\n- Layer 1 Subtask: Reaching Out to Meredith\n  Description: In the dim light of your cluttered apartment, you settle in front of your computer, determination buzzing in your veins. With Ronan's task weighing on your mind, you need to contact Meredith Stout\u2014a top-tier tech analyst who might provide insight on the lost robot. The neon glow flickers as you pull up your email client, the digital abyss stretching out before you.

Has a parent_id of \"contact_meredith_stout.1\"\n5. Has is_generated set to \"False\" (as this is a scripted, not generated subtask)\n\nYour response MUST be a JSON object with this format:\n{\n  \"subtask_id\": \"contact_meredith_stout.2\",\n  \"title\": \"Brief, catchy title for the subtask\",\n  \"description\": \"Clear description of what happens in this subtask\",\n  \"dialogue\": \"The main narrative text for the player\",\n  \"npc_reactions\": {\"npc_name\": \"reaction description\", ...},\n  \"player_options\": [\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"],\n  \"parent_id\": \"contact_meredith_stout.1\",\n  \"layer\": 2,\n  \"is_generated\": false\n}\n\nYOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON: A single JSON object with the exact keys shown above.\n",
