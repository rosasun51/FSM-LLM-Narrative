After a violent falling-out over a double-crossed arms deal, he fled to another country and laid low for years. Now in his early 40s, he runs The Veil, a sleek, low-profile nightclub near the docks, which serves as a front for his true profession: a discreet and highly respected underground broker. Though deeply entrenched in the criminal world, Ronan operates by a personal code—precise, fair, and never personal. Despite his cold professionalism, he quietly looks out for those who earn his trust, and is known to remember small, human details others would overlook.",

      "goal_shift_point": "If either party violates agreed terms (e.g., attempting to double-cross, revealing identities, or bringing violence to The Veil), Ronan will shift from passive broker to active threat controller. He will intervene to de-escalate or neutralize the threat to protect his business and maintain control.",
