  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"1\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"1\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"1.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"1.1.1\", \"1.1.2\", \"1.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"1.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"1.2.1\", \"1.2.2\", \"1.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"1.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"1.3.1\", \"1.3.2\", \"1.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 3 with ID \"1.3\" that has parent_id \"1.2\".\n\nPreviously generated subtasks:\n- Layer 1 Subtask: The Assignment\n  Description: The player meets with Ronan, the gangster boss, in a dimly-lit office to receive a crucial task: pick up a package and get advice about contacting Meredith Stout.\n- Layer 2 Subtask: Navigating the Underworld\n  Description: The player attempts to make contact with Meredith Stout as per Ronan's assignments, facing unexpected challenges and potential misunderstandings.\n\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Beginning\",\n  \"location\": \"0\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"Chapter == 1 and GameDay == 1\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"In a dimly-lit office, the gangster boss sits behind a polished desk.

This subtask:\n1. Directly addresses the transitioning question\n2. Will be the primary response at this layer level \n3. Forms a parent for the next level's subtask or alternatives\n4. Has a parent_id of \"1.2\"\n5. Has is_generated set to \"False\" (as this is a scripted, not generated subtask)\n\nYour response MUST be a JSON object with this format:\n{\n  \"subtask_id\": \"1.3\",\n  \"title\": \"Brief, catchy title for the subtask\",\n  \"description\": \"Clear description of what happens in this subtask\",\n  \"dialogue\": \"The main narrative text for the player\",\n  \"npc_reactions\": {\"npc_name\": \"reaction description\", ...},\n  \"player_options\": [\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"],\n  \"parent_id\": \"1.2\",\n  \"layer\": 3,\n  \"is_generated\": false\n}\n\nYOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON: A single JSON object with the exact keys shown above.\n",
