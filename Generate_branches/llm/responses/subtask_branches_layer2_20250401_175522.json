Your job is to generate alternative narrative branches in response to a transitioning question.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree has a ROOT TASK (ID \"meet_with_meredith_stout\") with 3 layers of subtasks\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"meet_with_meredith_stout\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n\nYou are generating 3 alternative branches for Layer 2.\nThese alternatives will have:\n- Parent ID: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2\" (the scripted subtask of this layer)\n- Layer: 2\n- IDs: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.3\" (for each alternative)\n- is_generated: true (as these are generated alternatives)\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"scene_name\": \"Meet with Meredith Stout\",\n  \"location\": \"1\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"Chapter == 1 and 2<= GameDay <4\",\n    \"additional_conditions\": \"Completed contact with Meredith Stout\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"The alley was a scar of cracked concrete and rusting pipes, choked by tangled wires and creeping decay.
