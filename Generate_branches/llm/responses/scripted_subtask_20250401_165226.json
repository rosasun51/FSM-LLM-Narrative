  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"1\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"1\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"1.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"1.1.1\", \"1.1.2\", \"1.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"1.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"1.2.1\", \"1.2.2\", \"1.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"1.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"1.3.1\", \"1.3.2\", \"1.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 3 with ID \"1.3\" that has parent_id \"1.2\".\n\nPreviously generated subtasks:\n- Layer 1 Subtask: Navigating the Shadows\n  Description: The player approaches the tense and decayed alley where Meredith Stout awaits. They must carefully navigate the dangerous environment to discuss the whereabouts of the missing goods.\n- Layer 2 Subtask: Tension Under Neon Lights\n  Description: Amidst a tense atmosphere, Meredith Stout confronts the player, pressing for vital information about the missing goods. The player's choices here will sway her perception, leading to potential conflict or cooperation.\n\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"scene_name\": \"Meet with Meredith Stout\",\n  \"location\": \"1\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"Chapter == 1 and 2<= GameDay <4\",\n    \"additional_conditions\": \"Completed contact with Meredith Stout\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"The alley was a scar of cracked concrete and rusting pipes, choked by tangled wires and creeping decay.
