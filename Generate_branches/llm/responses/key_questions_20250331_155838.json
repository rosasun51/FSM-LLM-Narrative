  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to analyze the task information and generate THREE key transitioning questions that form a sequential narrative flow for this task.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE: \nThe narrative structure consists of a ROOT TASK (Level 0) with 3 layers of subtasks below it:\n- Level 1: Main scripted subtasks responding to the first transitioning question\n- Level 2: Subtasks branching from Level 1, responding to the second transitioning question\n- Level 3: Subtasks branching from Level 2, responding to the third transitioning question\n\nThe ID structure follows this hierarchical pattern:\n- Root task has ID \"1\"\n- Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"1.1\"\n- Layer 1 generated subtasks: \"1.1.1\", \"1.1.2\", \"1.1.3\" (alternatives, is_generated: True)\n- Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"1.2\"\n- Layer 2 generated subtasks: \"1.2.1\", \"1.2.2\", \"1.2.3\" (alternatives, is_generated: True)\n- Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"1.3\"\n- Layer 3 generated subtasks: \"1.3.1\", \"1.3.2\", \"1.3.3\" (alternatives, is_generated: True)\n\nYOUR TASK: Generate THREE key transitioning questions that MUST follow this structure:\n1. First question: Establishes the initial situation and task parameters\n2. Second question: Directly builds upon the first question, introducing complications/challenges\n3. Third question: Addresses how the situation resolves based on developments from questions 1 and 2\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Beginning\",\n  \"location\": \"0\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"Chapter == 1 and GameDay == 1\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"In a dimly-lit office, the gangster boss sits behind a polished desk. Soft neon glows mix with shadows on modern furnishings, and discreet digital screens complement classic d\\u00e9cor. The atmosphere hints at hidden power and secrets, with a quiet hum from concealed devices setting a mysterious tone.\",\n  \"interactive_environment_objects\": null,\n  \"interactive_npc\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ronan\",\n      \"additional_conditions\": null,\n      \"goal\": \"Assign the player a task to pick up goods and provide advice on contacting Meredith Stout.\",\n      \"emotion_pool\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"0\",\n          \"trigger_condition\": null,\n          \"goal\": \"Assign tasks to the player, provide advice, and answer the player's questions.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"1\",\n          \"trigger_condition\": \"The player asks about the task too many times or constantly goes off-topic\",\n          \"goal\": \"Seriously remind the player that this task is very important.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"scene_end_state_reference\": {\n    \"end_condition1\": \"The player indicates understanding of the task\",\n    \"end_condition2\": \"The player explicitly refuses the task\"\n  }\n}\n\nYou MUST respond with a JSON array containing EXACTLY THREE transitioning questions in sequential order:\n[\"First question about the initial situation?\", \"Second question about complications?\", \"Third question about resolution?\"]\n\nYOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON: A single array containing exactly three string elements.\n",
