Your job is to generate a scripted subtask based on the task information and transitioning question provided.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE CONTEXT:\n- The narrative tree consists of a ROOT TASK (ID \"meet_with_meredith_stout\") with 3 layers of subtasks below it\n- Each layer has one main scripted subtask followed by generated alternatives\n- The ID structure follows this pattern:\n  - Root task: \"meet_with_meredith_stout\"\n  - Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1\"\n  - Layer 1 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2\"\n  - Layer 2 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.2.3\" (is_generated: true)\n  - Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3\"\n  - Layer 3 generated alternatives: \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.1\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.2\", \"meet_with_meredith_stout.3.3\" (is_generated: true)\n\nYou are generating a scripted subtask for Layer 1 with ID \"meet_with_meredith_stout.1\" that has parent_id \"meet_with_meredith_stout\".\n\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"scene_name\": \"Meet with Meredith Stout\",\n  \"location\": \"1\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"Chapter == 1 and 2<= GameDay <4\",\n    \"additional_conditions\": \"Completed contact with Meredith Stout\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"The alley was a scar of cracked concrete and rusting pipes, choked by tangled wires and creeping decay.
