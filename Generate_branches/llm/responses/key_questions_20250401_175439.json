  "prompt": "\nYou serve as a story architect for a narrative game with a hierarchical task structure. Your job is to analyze the task information and generate THREE key transitioning questions that form a sequential narrative flow for this task.\n\nIMPORTANT STRUCTURE: \nThe narrative structure consists of a ROOT TASK (Level 0) with 3 layers of subtasks below it:\n- Level 1: Main scripted subtasks responding to the first transitioning question\n- Level 2: Subtasks branching from Level 1, responding to the second transitioning question\n- Level 3: Subtasks branching from Level 2, responding to the third transitioning question\n\nThe ID structure follows this hierarchical pattern:\n- Root task has ID \"1\"\n- Layer 1 scripted subtask: \"1.1\"\n- Layer 1 generated subtasks: \"1.1.1\", \"1.1.2\", \"1.1.3\" (alternatives, is_generated: True)\n- Layer 2 scripted subtask: \"1.2\"\n- Layer 2 generated subtasks: \"1.2.1\", \"1.2.2\", \"1.2.3\" (alternatives, is_generated: True)\n- Layer 3 scripted subtask: \"1.3\"\n- Layer 3 generated subtasks: \"1.3.1\", \"1.3.2\", \"1.3.3\" (alternatives, is_generated: True)\n\nYOUR TASK: Generate THREE key transitioning questions that MUST follow this structure:\n1. First question: Establishes the initial situation and task parameters\n2. Second question: Directly builds upon the first question, introducing complications/challenges\n3. Third question: Addresses how the situation resolves based on developments from questions 1 and 2\n\nTask Information:\n{\n  \"scene_name\": \"Meet with Meredith Stout\",\n  \"location\": \"1\",\n  \"trigger_conditions\": {\n    \"time_condition\": \"Chapter == 1 and 2<= GameDay <4\",\n    \"additional_conditions\": \"Completed contact with Meredith Stout\"\n  },\n  \"environment\": \"The alley was a scar of cracked concrete and rusting pipes, choked by tangled wires and creeping decay.
